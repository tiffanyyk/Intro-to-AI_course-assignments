/** WRITE YOUR TIPS IN THIS FILE **/
Tip #1:
In your alternate heuristic function, it is important to determine whether it is impossible for a given state to reach a goal state (when a state is in "deadlock").
For such states, you should give the heuristic value a very large number, like float("inf"), in order to accurately account for the fact that the goal will never be reached.

Tip #2:
A common cause of deadlock is when a box (not in a storage location) gets pushed into a corner, when boxes get pushed into a 2 by 2 group of 4, and when two boxes are pushed to be side by side along an edge. 
Checking for these scenarios will cover many of the deadlock scenarios that can occur and greatly enhance your heuristic function.

Tip #3:
The computation of your heuristic can be time costly, depending on your approach.
However, checking for all your deadlock scenarios first will allow you to simply return infinity if there is a deadlock and avoid spending time to compute the heuristic value.
